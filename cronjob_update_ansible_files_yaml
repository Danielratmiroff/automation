# To Get this to work, you need to add your git ssh key to the ssh agent
# eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# ssh-add -l
# Then, you need to get your SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable and export it in your script
# env |  grep SSH_AUTH_SOCK
# export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-3y8j4JY2q6/agent.1254

# How to debug?
